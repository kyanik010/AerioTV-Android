/**
 * Media3 ExoPlayer holder mirroring [MPVPlayerHolder]'s lifetime contract.
 * Hoists ONE [ExoPlayer] instance out of any single composable lifecycle so
 * the underlying codec + audio renderer survives PlayerScreen <-> mini
 * transitions and channel switches. Without this, every nav transition
 * tears the player down and the next open costs a fresh MediaCodec
 * allocation + DataSource warm-up.
 *
 * Pattern (intentionally identical to MPVPlayerHolder so PlayerScreen
 * doesn't need to know which player is mounted):
 *   - PersistentExoWindow.factory calls [acquireOrCreate] on first
 *     composition. Subsequent calls (after back-out + resume) return
 *     the same ExoPlayer reference; the caller just rebinds the
 *     PlayerView's surface to it.
 *   - AndroidView's onRelease calls [detach] instead of release(),
 *     leaving ExoPlayer alive while surface is unparented.
 *   - X-close goes through [destroy] which releases the player.
 *
 * Live TV scaffold for the Media3 migration. VOD, MediaSession, and
 * multiview are subsequent tasks (#62, #63, #64).
 *
 * Threading: all entry points expect main thread (ExoPlayer's
 * `Looper.getMainLooper()` requirement).

        //     each recovered only by the 6s reload-watchdog = a visible freeze+skip.
        //   - min=2500/max=5000 kept too shallow a steady-state cushion, so the
        //     jittery ~realtime TS feed drained it to empty ~once a minute, the
        //     recurring mid-stream micro-stutter seen in a 5-min on-device watch.

        // (demuxer-lavf-analyzeduration 1.5s / probesize 1MB). The two levers

        //   - The STEADY cushion (min 4s / max 8s) is what suppresses the
        //     recurring mid-stream micro-stutter: it gives the jittery ~realtime
        //     TS feed real headroom instead of the old 2.5s that drained to empty
        //     ~once a minute. A 5-min on-device watch went from ~6 rebuffers to 1.

        //     latency. 500ms was far too eager (started on a partial GOP -> the
        //     cold-start starve->reload and the MediaTek decoder CodecException);
