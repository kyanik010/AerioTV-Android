// SettingsRoute.kt
//
// Settings redesign Phase B2 (SettingsUIRedesign.md B1/B2): the typed route
// model and back stack that replace the six independent `mutableStateOf`
// booleans in `SettingsTabContent`.
//
// Why a stack instead of booleans: with booleans, "what is on top" is encoded
// implicitly in the ORDER OF THE `when` BRANCHES, in two places that have to
// agree (the BackHandler and the content `when`). Adding a screen means
// remembering to slot it into both at the right position. A stack makes
// "innermost" literal, so Back is a pop and the ordering rules fall out of
// push order.
//
// Rev 2 requirement: PlaylistDetail and EditPlaylist carry the playlist id IN
// THE ROUTE (like Apple's `.server(id)`) so restoration after a fold or
// process death does not depend on unsaved view-model selection state.
//
// Selection is NOT the stack (Rev 2): in the two-pane hosts of B3/B4 the pane
// selection lives in its own value and rail/sidebar browsing never pushes, so
// Back can never replay browse history. This stack holds only the pushes ABOVE
// the pane baseline.
