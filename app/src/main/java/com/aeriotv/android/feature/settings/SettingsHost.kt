// SettingsHost.kt
//
// Settings redesign Phase B3 (SettingsUIRedesign.md B3): the tablet list-detail
// host. A 320dp touch sidebar of selected-tonal rows on the left, the selected
// pane on the right, and a hairline between them.
//
// Hand-rolled rather than material3-adaptive, per the plan's decision: the
// library's NavigableListDetailPaneScaffold owns its own back stack, which
// would fight the one B2 just built, and it buys nothing this layout needs.
//
// Rev 2, SELECTION IS NOT THE STACK. The sidebar mutates `selection` and never
// pushes, so Back can never replay sidebar browsing. `SettingsNavState` holds
// only what was pushed ABOVE the selected pane. The posture mapping in
// [rememberSettingsPaneSelection] translates between the two when the window
// crosses the two-pane threshold (rotation, fold, resizable-window drag).
